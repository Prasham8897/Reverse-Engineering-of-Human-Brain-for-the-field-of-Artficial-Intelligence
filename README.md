# Reverse Engineering of Human-Brain for the field of Artficial Intelligence
In this term paper, Human brain was reverse engineered so as to link it with development of Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) and Convolutional Neural networks. Biological Neuron was understood and using reverse engineering it was modeled to artificial neurons which can then further be connected to form ANN which would model Biological neural networks.
